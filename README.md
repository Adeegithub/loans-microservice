I'm developing a project to demonstrate microservices architecture using SpringBoot. This system is developing for a Bank. This system contains of 3 services namely, 
1. Accounts Service
2. Cards Service and 
3. Loan Service. 

**This repo is for the loans service.**

You can navigate to the other services using the following links.

2. Cards Service
3. Loan Service (This Repo)
